# Custom-New-Tab by Gavnin
 First off thank you for taking the time to look at this project and to hopefully go through the steps and use it yourself. 
 This is a custom New Tab destination that adds things like shortcuts, clock, and other customizable features. This works 
 in conjuntion with Jim Schubert's 'New Tab Redirect' Google Chrome/FireFox extension. To get that go to this link : https://tinyurl.com/48sx4khz and follow 
 the steps to download that extension. That is all the prerequisites for this project so now we can get into the actual code :> 


 # Light Mode or Dark Mode
 In this Repo you can choose between two default builds; LightGruvBox and DarkGruvBox. Being that this project is made of mostly CSS and HTML you can change these but those are the premades. Below are example imges of both
