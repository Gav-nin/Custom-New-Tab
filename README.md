# Custom-New-Tab by Gavnin
 First off thank you for taking the time to look at this project and to hopefully go through the steps and use it yourself. 
 This is a custom New Tab destination that adds things like shortcuts, clock, and other customizable features. This works 
 in conjuntion with Jim Schubert's 'New Tab Redirect' Google Chrome/FireFox extension. To get that go to this link : https://tinyurl.com/48sx4khz and follow 
 the steps to download that extension. That is all the prerequisites for this project so now we can get into the actual code :> 


 # Light Mode or Dark Mode
 In this Repo you can choose between two default builds; LightGruvBox and DarkGruvBox. Being that this project is made of mostly CSS and HTML you can change these but those are the premades. Below are example imges of both
![DarkGruvBox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97905862/183939054-cbb8ae13-cbcd-44df-aca0-0dcadd6d83fc.PNG)
![LightGruvBox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97905862/183939057-fea97810-b74a-494d-85bb-c8f514d65a7b.PNG)

You'll be able to change the colors to whatever you want if you like. Just download the corrosponding folder to th theme that you want and we'll get into the installation :>

# Installation

Now youll want to download or move the entire  folder to somewhere safe in your drive so that you won't accidentally delete it or what not, I like to put on my Desktop or in the Documents folder. Now that youve done that you can open the folder, go to the Main.html file and double click it. A menu should pop up and selece the browsere that you mainly use, for me thats Google Chrome. Now you should see the page that you downloaded in you browser. Go up to the URL bar and copy that link.

Now go to your add-ons/extentions and open the options for New Tab Redirect and paste the link to the bar and click save
